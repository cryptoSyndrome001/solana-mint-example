                      <p>A major component to the profitability of crypto mining is electricity costs. Texas has some of the most competitive
                        rates in all of America, which means more passive income for you.</p>

                      <p>
                        Cryptocurrency mining is the physical part of cryptocurrency. It is not only a necessary part of crypto, but the base itself. Countries like China, Russia, and huge corporations are taking over the cryptocurrency mining industry. As more big money invests in crypto mining, the cost of entry goes up as well. In order to keep cryptocurrency in the peoples hands we need to decentralize mining.

                        The project will be jointly owned by the NFT holders. NFT holders will receive 100% of mined funds through monthly airdrops to their wallets. The founders will receive presale access as we continue to grow.

                        100% of the funds will be allocated to the project. 75% will go into the mining farm itself which leaves 25% for future development, maintenance, and backup funds.
